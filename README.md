# CPU Scheduling Algorithm and Banker's Algorithm visualization
The main theme behind the project is to use the basic concepts of computer
graphics to visualize CPU scheduling algorithms along with Bankerâ€™s
algorithm. What we learnt from this project is how to build the project from
scratch and the basics of computer graphics by programming in OpenGL.
